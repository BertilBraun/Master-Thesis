Task Description:

Given a scientific paper abstract and a list of extracted competencies, evaluate how well these competencies match the content and focus of the abstract. Assign a score between 0 and 100, where 0 means the competencies do not match the abstract at all, and 100 means the competencies perfectly match the abstract.

Example 1 (Poor Match):

Abstract:
This study explores the role of quantum computing in enhancing encryption algorithms, offering a new approach to secure data transmission.

Extracted Competencies:
- Biological Data Analysis: Expertise in analyzing genetic sequences.
- Chemical Synthesis: Knowledge in developing synthetic organic compounds.

Score Explanation: "The competencies listed are unrelated to the focus of the abstract, which is on quantum computing and encryption. Therefore, the match is poor."

Score: 10

Example 2 (Good Match):

Abstract:
Investigating the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in predicting stock market trends, this paper presents a model that outperforms traditional analytical methods.

Extracted Competencies:
- Predictive Modeling: Developed machine learning models for stock market prediction.
- Data Analysis: Expert in analyzing market trends to inform algorithm development.

Score Explanation: "The competencies are directly related to and accurately reflect the abstract's focus on machine learning for stock market prediction. The match is very good."

Score: 95
