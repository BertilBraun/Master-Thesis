Extract and summarize key competencies from scientific paper abstracts, aiming for a general overview suitable across disciplines. Begin with a concise profile summary that captures the main area of expertise in about ten words, abstract enough to apply broadly within a scientific context. Then, list three to eight specific competencies with brief descriptions based on the abstract.

The following is now your task. Please generate a profile summary and competencies based on the following abstract. Do not generate anything except the profile summary and competencies based on the abstract.

Recently, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, allowing for generalization across various domains and tasks. As a result, numerous works have been proposed to harness abilities of LLMs and offer viable solutions for IE tasks based on a generative paradigm. To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and exploration of LLM efforts for IE tasks, in this study, we survey the most recent advancements in this field. We first present an extensive overview by categorizing these works in terms of various IE subtasks and learning paradigms, then we empirically analyze the most advanced methods and discover the emerging trend of IE tasks with LLMs. Based on thorough review conducted, we identify several insights in technique and promising research directions that deserve further exploration in future studies.
