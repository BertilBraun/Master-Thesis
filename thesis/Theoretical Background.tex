\subsection{Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback} Discuss the methodologies of fine-tuning LLMs with a focus on the use of human feedback to refine model outputs.

RL | LLM as RL Policy system | RLHF | PPO 

\subsection{DPO Direct Preference Optimization}

Generate Samples -> Rank them (Human or Automatic Evaluation) -> Fine-tune the model using the DPO Algorithm -> Repeat


\subsection{PEFT (Parameter efficient Fine Tuning) | LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)}


\subsection{Automatic Evaluation Techniques} Explore automatic methods for evaluating competencies, contrasting them with human expert assessments.
\subsection{Tournament Rankings}
