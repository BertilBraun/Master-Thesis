        "content": "Example 1:\n\n\n\nAbstract 1:\nMany challenges of chemoselectivity arise from the requirement to manipulate incompatible functional groups. Synthetic methods that do not rely on protecting groups are of strategic significance to chemical synthesis. Particularly valuable are molecules with reactive functionalities that are kinetically stabilized against inter- or intramolecular reactions with each other. We have developed a simple access to molecules that contain both ketone and N-H aziridine functionalities. These compounds were found to undergo highly selective reduction and carbonyl addition reactions, making them versatile precursors to complex amines.\n\nAbstract 2:\nPeople in contemporary industrial societies encounter countless novel materials that did not exist previously, many of which present risks to health and environment. In this article, we build on the concept of \u201cmaterials sovereignty\u201d as the right of people to use and be surrounded by environmentally benign, non-toxic, and renewing materials in their everyday lives. As a rights-based approach, materials sovereignty may help change the politics of governing materials. We suggest that social movements that explicitly base interventions into design on materials sovereignty may be better able to gain traction in changing industrial production. We consider the case of nanotechnology as a particularly challenging field for social movement intervention. We review several pathways that have been used by social movement organizations in attempts to influence the development of nanomaterials, but which have met with limited success. We more closely examine three participatory pathways through which social movements could intervene more directly into material design: participatory technology assessment, collaboration with industry, and co-design. We identify three key elements of materials sovereignty: participatory knowledge systems, which create multi-directional flows of knowledge and agency; the embedding of citizen voices into design processes; and building accountability systems. Of the pathways we examine here, co-design appears to be the most promising from a theoretical and ethical perspective, but there remain significant institutional and organizational challenges for bringing it into practice.\n\n\nProfile 1:\nDomain: \"Materials Sovereignty and Sustainable Material Development\"\n\nCompetencies:\n- Materials Sovereignty Concept Development: The author demonstrates expertise in developing the concept of \"materials sovereignty\" as the right of people to use and be surrounded by environmentally benign, non-toxic, and renewing materials.\n- Social Movement Analysis: The author shows competency in analyzing social movements that aim to influence the development of nanotechnology and other materials.\n- Participatory Technology Assessment: The author demonstrates knowledge in participatory technology assessment, a pathway to intervene in material design.\n- Collaboration with Industry: The author highlights the importance of collaboration with industry in the development of sustainable materials.\n- Co-Design: The author shows competency in understanding the co-design approach, a pathway that embeds citizen voices into material design processes.\n- Ethical and Institutional Challenges: The author demonstrates knowledge of the ethical and institutional challenges in bringing co-design into practice.\n- Material Design and Development: The author shows competency in analyzing various materials and their potential impact on health and environment.\n- Materials Sovereignty Elements: The author demonstrates expertise in identifying key elements of materials sovereignty, such as participatory knowledge systems, citizen voices in design processes, and accountability systems.\n\n\n\nProfile 2:\nDomain: \"Chemical Synthesis and Materials Sovereignty\"\n\nCompetencies:\n- Chemical Synthesis: The author demonstrates expertise in designing and synthesizing molecules with specific functionalities, such as ketone and N-H aziridine, and manipulating them in a selective manner for various reactions, like reduction and carbonyl addition.\n- Kinetic Stabilization: The author demonstrates an understanding of kinetic stabilization, which allows reactive functionalities to avoid inter- or intramolecular reactions with each other, making the molecules versatile precursors to complex amines.\n- Materials Sovereignty: The author shows competency in advocating for the right of people to use and be surrounded by environmentally benign, non-toxic, and renewing materials in their everyday lives.\n- Rights-based Approach: The author demonstrates expertise in applying a rights-based approach to materials governance, emphasizing the importance of citizen voices in design processes and accountability systems.\n- Nanotechnology: The author shows competency in understanding the challenges of social movement intervention in the field of nanotechnology and its potential risks to health and environment.\n- Participatory Pathways: The author demonstrates knowledge of various participatory pathways, such as participatory technology assessment, collaboration with industry, and co-design, for social movements to intervene in material design.\n- Co-Design: The author highlights the potential of co-design as the most promising pathway for social movements to intervene in material design, considering its theoretical and ethical perspectives.\n- Institutional and Organizational Challenges: The author demonstrates an understanding of the institutional and organizational challenges that arise when implementing participatory pathways, like co-design, in practice.\n",

        "content": "Please assess the following competency profile in terms of its relevance to these scientific abstracts.\n\nAbstracts:\nAbstract 1:\nMaterials with photoswitchable electronic properties and conductance values that can be reversibly changed over many orders of magnitude are highly desirable. Metal-organic framework (MOF) films functionalized with photoresponsive spiropyran molecules demonstrated the general possibility to switch the conduction by light with potentially large on-off-ratios. However, the fabrication of MOF materials in a trial-and-error approach is cumbersome and would benefit significantly from in silico molecular design. Based on the previous proof-of-principle investigation, here, we design photoswitchable MOFs which incorporate spiropyran photoswitches at controlled positions with defined intermolecular distances and orientations. Using multiscale modelling and automated workflow protocols, four MOF candidates are characterized and their potential for photoswitching the conductivity is explored. Using ab initio calculations of the electronic coupling between the molecules in the MOF, we show that lattice distances and vibrational flexibility tremendously modulate the possible conduction photoswitching between spiropyran- and merocyanine-based MOFs upon light absorption, resulting in average on-off ratios higher than 530 and 4200 for p- and n-conduction switching, respectively. Further functionalization of the photoswitches with electron-donating/-withdrawing groups is demonstrated to shift the energy levels of the frontier orbitals, permitting a guided design of new spiropyran-based photoswitches towards controlled modification between electron and hole conduction in a MOF.\n\n\nAbstract 2:\nShine a light: A photo-conducting crystalline metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), thin film with high on\u2013off photocurrent ratio is prepared. The donor\u2013acceptor interactions between the porphyrin in the framework backbone of these oriented MOF thin films and C60 guests in the pores give rise to a rapid charge separation. Subsequently, holes and electrons are transported through separate channels formed by porphyrin and by C60, respectively.\n\nDescription unavailable\nAbstract\nPhotoconductivity is a characteristic property of semi-conductors. Herein, we present a photo-conducting crystalline metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) thin film with an on\u2013off photocurrent ratio of two orders of magnitude. These oriented, surface-mounted MOF thin films (SURMOFs), contain porphyrin in the framework backbone and C60 guests, loaded in the pores using a layer-by-layer process. By comparison with results obtained for reference MOF structures and based on DFT calculations, we conclude that donor\u2013acceptor interactions between the porphyrin of the host MOF and the C60 guests give rise to a rapid charge separation. Subsequently, holes and electrons are transported through separate channels formed by porphyrin and by C60, respectively. The ability to tune the properties and energy levels of the porphyrin and fullerene, along with the controlled organization of donor\u2013acceptor pairs in this regular framework offers potential to increase the photoconduction on\u2013off ratio.\n\n\nAbstract 3:\nPhotoswitching: Metal\u2013organic framework films were loaded with spiropyran, which photoisomerizes under UV light irradiation to the merocyanine form with a larger conjugated electron system. This isomerization results in a remote-controlled reversible modification of the material conductance by one order of magnitude.\n\nDescription unavailable\nAbstract\nConductive metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) as well as smart, stimuli-responsive MOF materials have attracted considerable attention with respect to advanced applications in energy harvesting and storage as well as in signal processing. Here, the conductance of MOF films of type UiO-67 with embedded photoswitchable nitro-substituted spiropyrans was investigated. Under UV irradiation, the spiropyran (SP) reversibly isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, a zwitterionic molecule with an extended conjugated \u03c0-system. The light-induced SP\u2013MC isomerization allows for remote control over the conductance of the SP@UiO-67 MOF film, and the conductance can be increased by one order of magnitude. This research has the potential to contribute to the development of a new generation of photoelectronic devices based on smart hybrid materials.\n\n\nAbstract 4:\nThe arrangement of organic semiconductor molecules in a material can be modulated using different supramolecular approaches, including the metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) approach. These arrangements result in different frameworks topologies and structures. Fabrication of materials comprising optimized assemblies and functional molecules enables efficient tailoring of material properties, including electronic responses. Since semiconducting properties are sensitive to subtle changes in the nanostructure of the material, the exploitation of MOFs has promising potential in the development of new materials with designed structure and function. Based on decade-long method development, virtual design strategies have become ever more important, and such design methods profit from the availability of automated tools. Such tools enable screening of huge libraries of organic molecules in in silico models of the structure of three-dimensional nanoscale assemblies as the prerequisite to predict their functionality. In this report, we present and demonstrate the application of an automated workflow tool developed for MOFs of the primitive cubic (PCU) topology. We use pentacene-based ditopic linkers of a varied chemical composition and pillar linkers of different molecular sizes to automatically generate PCU MOFs, sample their structural dynamics at finite temperature, and predict electronic coupling matrix elements in vibrationally averaged assemblies. We demonstrate the change of the intermolecular ordering in the resulting MOFs and its impact on the semiconducting properties. This development lays the basis of an extendable framework to automatically model a wide variety of MOFs and characterize their function with respect to properties, such as conduction properties, absorption, and interaction with light. The developed workflow protocol and tools are available at https://github.com/KIT-Workflows/PCU-MOF.\n\n\nAbstract 5:\nLayer-by-layer synthesis of surface-coordinated metal\u2013organic frameworks (SURMOF) enables the assembly of asymmetric, dipolar linkers into non-centrosymmetric pillar-layered structures. Using appropriate substrate terminations can yield oriented growth with the dipoles aligned perpendicular to the surface. The aligned pillar linkers give rise to a built-in electrostatic field. In addition, the non-centrosymmetric structure of the SURMOF gives rise to intriguing nonlinear optical features, such as second harmonic generation. Previous research with methyl-functionalized bipyridine pillar linkers have demonstrated that this approach works in principle, but so far the total degree of alignment is only very small. Herein, a multiscale modelling approach is presented for in-silico SURMOF assembly to identify and overcome limitations in the growth of pillar-layered SURMOFs and to develop a strategy to maximize linker alignment. Using master equation models and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that the formation of a highly ordered state corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium is often prevented by long-lasting transient effects. Based on ab initio binding energies for a wide selection of hypothetical pillar linkers, a fast-binding, slow-relaxation scheme is able to be identified during the SURMOF growth for a range of different pillar linkers. These observations allow them to derive a rational strategy for the design of novel linkers to yield SURMOF-based non-centrosymmetric materials with substantially improved properties.\n\n\nProfile
