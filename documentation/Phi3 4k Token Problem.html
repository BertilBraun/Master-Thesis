Introduction TheMessage-Passing Interface (MPI) [6,15,29] is arguably the most widespread communication interfaceforwritingdedicatedparallelapplicationson(pri-marily)distributed memorymachines. 1The programming model of MPI is a distributed memory modelwith explicit message-passing communication among processes,coupledwithpowerfulcollectiveoperations over sets of processes.

We expressly say so when addressingMPI-2 extensions.ciently implementable on a wide variety of hardware platforms. Indeed, many high-quality vendor implementations achieve MPI communication performance closetothatoftheirnativecommunicationsubsystem. Apart from basic semantic properties (liveness etc.) there are no performancemodel or performanceguar-anteesassociatedwithMPI,andtheMPIstandardstipulates no performance requirements for a valid MPI implementation. Without empirical performance data itisthereforenotpossibletopredict/analyzetheperformance of a parallel application using MPI, much less to predict and obtain good performance when moving to anotherplatformand/orMPI implementation.

Relatedwork Benchmarking has always played an important role in high-performance computing. For MPI, severalbenchmarksexistwhichdifferinphilosophy,goals,andlevel of ambition. In this section we brie\ufb02y review someotherwell-knownMPIbenchmarksinrelationtoSKaMPI;the discussionis notmeanttobeexhaustive. Ageneraldiscussionofproblemsandpitfallsin(MPI) benchmarking can be found in [7] and [10]; SKaMPIadherestothesoundadviceofthesepapers. Benchmarkingofapplicationkernels[1,2,18]istraditionallyusedtogetanideaoftheoverallperformanceofagivenmachine,butsuchbenchmarksmeasurecommunicationinaspeci\ufb01c,complexcontextandcanonly indirectlybeusedtoguidethedevelopmentofef\ufb01cientprograms. A widely used MPI benchmark is the mpptest shipped with the MPICH implementation of MPI [8,16]; it measures nearly all MPI operations, but is less \ufb02exible than SKaMPI and has limited coverage of user-de\ufb01ned datatypes. The low-level part of thePARKBENCH benchmarks [18] measures communication performance and provides a result database, but does not give much information about the performance of individual MPI operations. The MPI part ofP.J. Mucci\u2019s Low-Level Characterization Benchmarks (LLCbench ) [13],mpbench , pursues similar goals to SKaMPI, but it covers only a part of MPI and makesrather rough measurements assuming a \u201cdead\u201d machine. The Pallas MPI Benchmark (PMB)[17]is easy touseandhasasimple,well-de\ufb01nedmeasurementpro-cedure, but covers relatively few functions, and offers no graphical evaluation. PMB is one of the few MPI benchmarksthatcoversMPI-2functionality(one-sidedcommunications,some MPI-I/O).Rolf Rabenseifner\u2019s effective bandwidth benchmark [4] attempts to give a realisticpictureoftheachievablecommunicationband-width. Bandwidth is measured by a ring pattern over allprocesses,whichis implementedusingbothsimple send and receive operations, as well as by a collectiveMPI_Alltoallv operation. Results from a number of high-performance platforms are publicly available. The effective bandwidth benchmarkhas recently beencomplementedbya similarI/Obenchmark[20,21]. A comparison of SKaMPI, PMB, mpptest and mpbench benchmarksisgivenin[14]forbenchmarkingMPI onan SGI Origin2000. The benchmarksgive roughlysimilarresults,butdifferin\ufb01nerdetailsdueto different assumptions on use of cache, and placementand size of communication buffers. The mpbench is con\ufb01rmed to be sensitive to other activities on the machine. Many studies measure selected functions in more detail [5,19,22] but the codes are often not publicly available, not user con\ufb01gurable, and not designed foreaseofuse,portability,androbustmeasurements.\nR.Reussner et al. / SKaMPI: a comprehensive benchmark for public benchmarking of MPI 57 2. Performanceconsiderations MPIisanextensiveinterfaceandcommunicationcan be expressed in many different ways. MPI offers twobasictypesofcommunication: point-to-pointmessage-passingwhereinformationispassedexplicitlybetween a sendinganda receivingprocess,andcollectivecommunicationwhereaset ofprocessesjointlyperformsacommunication operation, possibly involving compu-tation as in MPI_Reduce . For the applications programmer this raises a number of questions to be answeredinordertogetthebestpossibleperformanceon a given platform/MPI implementation, as well as forbeing able to obtain and/or predict performance whenmovingtoa differentplatform/MPIimplementation. Selection of communication mode: MPI differentiatesbetweenblockingandnon-blockingpoint-to-point communication, which can be further adapted by differentcommunication modes : standard, synchronous, ready and buffered. There also exist specialized com-pound operations like MPI_Sendrecv for simultaneous sending and receiving of data. It is possible to receive non-deterministically by using wildcards like MPI_ANY_TAG and/orMPI_ANY_SOURCE .Theperformance of point-to-point communication thus de-pends on the application context, the MPI implemen-tation, and hardware capabilities that may allow espe-ciallyef\ufb01cientimplementationsofsomeoftheseprimitivesin specialcontexts. Use of collective operations: A numberof collective operationsareavailable,butarenotalwaysused,eitherbecause they are not suf\ufb01ciently known, or becausetheir implementation is distrusted by some users. The question is whether an available MPI library provides good implementations. Do the implementations com-parefavorablytosimple(r), adhocpoint-to-pointbased implementations? Use of compound collectives: The MPI standard offers certain compound collective operations ( MPI_ Allreduce ,MPI_Allgather , and others) that can easily be expressed in terms of more primitivecollectives (e.g. MPI_Reduce ,MPI_Gather , and MPI_Bcast ). These compound operations are includedinMPIsincebetteralgorithmsthansimpleconcatenation of more primitive collectives exist. Is this exploitedin agivenMPI implementation?MPI user-de\ufb01ned datatypes: MPI has a powerful mechanism for working with user-structured, possiblynon-consecutivedata,butnotallMPIimplementations support user-de\ufb01ned datatypes equally well [9,30,26]. Is the best performance achieved by maintaining non-consecutivedata \u201cmanually\u201dor by relyingon the MPI mechanism? 3. The SKaMPIbenchmark The SKaMPI benchmark package consists of three parts: the skampi.c benchmarking program itself, an optional post-processing program (also a C program), and a report generation tool (a Perl script). It is complemented by an interactive public database of benchmark results, accessible through the WWW. A run of SKaMPI is controlled by a con\ufb01guration \ufb01le,.skampi , which can be modi\ufb01ed for more selective ordetailed benchmarking. A defaultcon\ufb01guration\ufb01le de\ufb01nes a standard run of the benchmark, and the re-sults from such a run can be reported to the SKaMPI database. The con\ufb01guration\ufb01le starts with a preamble identifying the benchmarker, the MPI implementation, and the machine and network used. It de\ufb01nes output andlog\ufb01les, and sets various default values. For the standard con\ufb01guration \ufb01le only the @MACHINE ,@NODE, @NETWORK ,@MPIVERSION and@USER\ufb01elds have to be modi\ufb01ed. The @MEMORY \ufb01eld controls the total size of communication buffers per processor (in KBytes). Figure 1 shows a sample con\ufb01guration \ufb01le. We referto thisexamplein thefollowing. ThebenchmarkprogramproducesanASCIItext\ufb01le skampi.out (selected by @OUTFILE ) in a documentedformat[27];itcanbefurtherprocessedforvarious purposes. The post-processing program is onlyneeded when the benchmark is run several times (see Section 4.3). Post-processing can also be done by SKaMPI itself by setting @POSTPROC toyes. The report generator reads the output \ufb01le and generates a postscript \ufb01le containing a graphical representation oftheresults. Thisincludescomparisonsofselectedmeasurements. Thereportgeneratorcanalsobecustomized viaaparameter\ufb01le. Reports(actually: output\ufb01les)arecollected in the SKaMPI result database in Karlsruhe, which can be queried for both textual and graphical presentationofresults(includingdownloadableencapsulatedpostscript\ufb01gures).

Thepingpong exchange is between two processors with maximumping-ponglatency;thisinordertoavoidmisleadingresults on clusters ofSMP machines. SKaMPI au-tomaticallyselectssuchapairbasedonmeasurements. Time is measured for one of the processes. Parameter variation is on message Length. There are currently9instancesoftheping-pongpattern,correspondingto(someof)thepossiblecombinationsofblocking andnon-blockingcommunicationcalls underdifferent modalities. The collective pattern measures operations that are collective in the sense that all processors play a symmetric role. Processors are synchronized with MPI_Barrier . Execution time is measured on process 0 (the root), and the running time of the barrier synchronizationis subtracted. Parametervariationcanbe either on message Length or number of Nodes. Thereareinstancesofthecollectivepatternforallcollective MPI communication operations, for collective bookkeepingoperationslike MPI_Comm_split ,and for some collectives implemented with point-to-point communication (e.g. gather-functions). There is also an instance of the collective pattern for measuring the performanceofthe memcpy function. Thiscanbeused to compare memory bandwidth with communication performance. Master-workerpattern: Certainperformance-relevant aspectssuchasthecontentionarisingwhenoneprocessor simultaneously communicates with several otherprocessors cannot be captured by the ping-pong pattern.

Noparametervariationis possible. 3.2. User-de\ufb01neddatatypes The MPI user-de\ufb01ned datatypes is a mechanism for describing the layout of user data in memory to the MPI implementation. All MPI communication oper-ations can operate with complex data described by a user-de\ufb01neddatatype. Communicationperformanceis usually dependent on the datatype, and the extent to which different MPI implementations work well with user-de\ufb01neddatatypes is knownto vary. To be able to assessthequalityofthedatatypehandling,SKaMPIincorporatesa set of datatype patterns that is orthogonal tothecommunicationpatterninstances. InSKaMPIthedatausedinameasurementsuiteare structuredaccordingtoeithera basetype oradatatype patternover a base type. Base types are de\ufb01ned in the preamble ( @BASETYPE1 ,...), and can be either a built-in MPI type (e.g. MPI_INT ,MPI_CHAR , MPI_DOUBLE ), or asimple structure given by a sequence of triples (c i,oi,ti)each consisting of repetitioncount,offset,andanbuilt-inMPItype. Astheunit of communication either a base type or a type pattern over a base type is selected ( Basetype_Number , Send_Datatype_Number ,andRecv_Datatype _Number ). SKaMPI contains a number of \ufb01xed type patterns,includinginstances of all MPI type constructors,aswellasvariousnestedtypes. Typepatternscan befurthercustomizedinthepreamble.

Measurementmechanisms We now describe SKaMPI\u2019s approach to ef\ufb01ciently measure execution times to a given relative accuracy \u03f5. The standard error is set in each suite by the Standard_error parameter.\n60 R.Reussner et al. / SKaMPI: a comprehensive benchmark for public benchmarking of MPI 4.1. Asingle parametersetting EachSKaMPIresultiseventuallyderivedfrommultiple measurements of single calls to particular MPI functionsasdeterminedbythepatterninstances,e.g.inthecorrespondingping-pongpatterninstancemeasurements of an MPI_Send followed by an MPI_Recv callforgivenmessagelengths. Foreachmeasurement, the number nof repetitions needed to achieve the requiredaccuracywiththeminimumeffortisdeterminedindividually. We need to control both the systematic andthestatisticalerror . Asystematic error occurs due to the measurement overheadincludingthe call of MPI_Wtime . It is usuallysmallandcanbecorrectedbysubtractingthetime for an empty measurement. Additionally,the user can choose to \u201cwarm up\u201d the cache by setting the number ofdummy @CACHEWARMUP callstotheMPIfunctions beforeactualmeasuringis started. Individual measurements are repeated in order to control three sources of statistical error :\ufb01nite clock resolution ,execution time \ufb02uctuations from various sources, and outliers. The total time for all repetitions must be at least MPI WTick /\u03f5in order to adapt to the \ufb01nite resolution of the clock. Execution time \ufb02uctuationsare controlled by monitoring the standard error \u03c3\u00afx:=\u03c3/\u221a nwhere nis thenumberofmeasurements, \u03c3=\u221a \u2211n i=1(xi\u2212\u00afx)2/nisthemeasuredstandarddeviation, and \u00afx=\u2211n i=1xi/nis the average execution time. The repetition is stopped as soon as \u03c3\u00afx/\u00afx<\u03f5. Additionally, upper and lower bounds on the number of repetitions are imposed, Min_Repetition and Max_Repetition . Under some operating conditionsonewillobservehuge outliersduetoexternaldelays such as operating system interrupts or other jobs. Thesecanmake \u00afxhighlyinaccurate. Therefore,weignoretheslowestandfastestruntimesbeforecomputingtheaverage,asdeterminedby Cut_Quantile .

SKaMPIvariesonlyoneoftheseparameters at a time. Two-dimensional measurements must be written as an explicit sequence of one-dimensionalmeasurements.\u22061\u22062d c ba (m  ,t  ) (m  ,t  )(m  ,t  ) (m  ,t  )a b cd Fig.3.

First, we measure at mmaxand at mmin\u03b3kfor all k suchthat mmin\u03b3k<m max,with \u03b3> 1. Onalogarithmicscalethese valuesareequidistant. Nowtheideais to adaptively subdivide those segments where a linearinterpolationwould be most inaccurate. Since nonlinearbehaviorof t P(m)betweentwomeasurementscan beoverlooked,theinitialstepwidth \u03b3shouldnotbetoo large ( \u03b3=\u221a 2or\u03b3=2are typical values).

Either of the surrounding segments can be extrapolated to\u201cpredict\u201dtheoppositepointofthemiddlesegment. Let\u22061and\u22062denotethepredictionerrors.

Thereasonforthelasttermintheminimumis toavoidsuper\ufb02uousmeasurementsnearsharpjumpsin runningtimeswhichoftenoccurwhereanMPIimplementation switches to a different communication pro-tocol. We keepall segmentsin a priorityqueue. If m b andmcare the abscissae of the segment with largest error, we subdivide it at\u221a mbmc. We stop when the maximum error drops below \u03f5or the upper bound on the numberofmeasurementsis exceeded. In the lattercase, the priority queue will ensure that the maximum error is minimized given the available computational resources. 4.3. Multipleruns If a measurement run crashed, the user can simply start the benchmark again. SKaMPI will identify the measurementwhichcausedthecrash,tryall suites notmeasuredyet,andwill \ufb01nallyretrythesuite whichled tothecrash. Thisprocesscanberepeated.\nR.Reussner et al. / SKaMPI: a comprehensive benchmark for public benchmarking of MPI 61 Fig. 4. The WWWinterface for querying the result database. If no crash occurred, all measurements are repeated yielding another output \ufb01le. Multiple output \ufb01les can be fed to a post-processor which generates an output\ufb01le containing the medians of the individual measure-ments.
